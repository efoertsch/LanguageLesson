
<p><b>Teach a Language! Learn a Language!</b></p>

<p>LanguageLesson provides a framework for anyone to create and conduct language lessons.</p>

<p> The steps to create your own set of language lessons are at http://fisincorporated.com/language-lesson/</p>

<p>To load a small example set of lessons for Turkish: 
<br />Go back to the main page 
<br />Press 'Language Maintenace' button 
<br />Press menu, or if displayed 'Load Language File'
<br />Select 'From the web' 
<br />Press OK (to use default download), then OK again
<br />
<br />
With this example you can explore the language lesson presentation options. (And my apologies to Turkey for my poor Turkish pronunciation!)</p>

<p>The current version incorporates text and audio. Future enhancements will allow video
 (say to organize a series of YouTube videos) to be added to the mix.

<p>Please email Eric Foertsch (efoertsch@fisincorporated.com) with bug reports or enhancement requests.
