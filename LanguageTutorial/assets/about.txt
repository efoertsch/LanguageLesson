
<p>LanguageLesson provides a framework for anyone to create and conduct language lessons.</p>

<p> The steps to create your own language tutorial are at www.fisincorporated.com/languagelesson</p>

<p>To load a small example set of lessons for Turkish press the button below. With this example you can explore the 
language lesson presentation options. (And my apologies to Turkey for my poor Turkish pronunciation!)</p>

<p>The current version incorporates text and audio. Future enhancements will allow video
 (say to organize a series of YouTube videos) to be added to the mix.

<p>Please email Eric Foertsch (efoertsch@fisincorporated.com) with bug reports or enhancement requests.
