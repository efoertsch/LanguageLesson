<p><b>Teach a Language! Learn a Language!</b></p>

<p>LanguageLesson provides a framework for anyone to create and conduct language lessons.</p>

<p>There on *no* lessons loaded when the app is first installed. There are however 2 small demo lessons you can install to see how the app works.</p>

<p>1. Turkish - This demonstrates how text and short audio phrases are presented. (My apologies to Turkey for my poor Turkish pronunciation!) <p>

<p>2. Japanese - This demonstrates how Youtube videos can be organized into lessons. (Disclaimer - The Youtube videos where produced by the Japanese Society of NYC and there is no connection between this project and the Japanese society. The videos were picked just to demonstrate how videos can be organized in lessons in this app.)
